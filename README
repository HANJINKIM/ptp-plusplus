A Precision Time Protocol (PTP) module for OMNeT++ INET 2.6. Allows to measure the PTP accuracy under different configurations and traffic loads, using any INET components (routers, etc.).
PTP is implemented as a UDP application as in the standard (https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/interps/1588-2008.html).

Some sub-modules were adapted from https://github.com/JenSte/omnet-ptp

Tested with:

- Mac OS X v. 10.9.5
- Ubuntu 14.04
